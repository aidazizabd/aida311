            <pre>
                        Three ducks pecked around           But it grew hotter and hotter
                        In a garden one warm day            Oh dear, it was warm
                        They wore beautiful coats           If they didn't find water
                        Of white feathers to display        Could it do them some harm?            
                    
                        They primped and they pampered      They might find a stream
                        These coats of pure white           Or a small pond would do
                        Their strutting and flapping        But when they could find none
                        Created quite a sight               They started to stew                        
                    
                        It was a lovely summer day          Finally they came across
                        And they adored the warm sun        A child's small pool
                        Just three little ducks             They plopped in immediately
                        Searching for a bit of fun          Their mom raised no fool
