                    <h2>Here's my cat, his name is "Peter"</h2>
                        <p>
                            My pet cat is Peter, and he is a Siamese cat. My younger brother named our cat Peter because he thought it would be funny to give our cat a human name. Most of my relatives also think that that is funny because their pet cats have names like ‘Fluffy.’ I wanted to name my cat Garfield, as the comic because I love reading Garfield comics, but now his name is Peter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Peter is a white cat with patches of fading black fur here are there. Around his face, there is a shadow-like patch of black fur, in the middle of which you can see Peter’s big, bright, and round blue eyes. Through the patch, you can also see his white whiskers in a sticking out fashion. Even Peter’s ears, paws, and tail are black, while the rest of his body is covered in soft white fur. This color patching of black and white is the common characteristic of all Siamese cats.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most cats are known to prefer to be on their own, being independent, etc. However, Peter is the opposite of that. He loves to get affection and attention and playing with everyone who wants to. His favorite person to play with is my father because he gives Peter lots of treats. Yes, Peter gets a lot of treats along with his two meals a day, which is why he is one of the fattest cats I have ever seen. His fatness makes him very cute, chubby, and fun to play with, and he is the best cuddle buddy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I really love my pet cat Peter because he is always there to keep me company when I don’t want to be alone. When I’m doing my homework or working on a project, watching TV, playing video games, or anything else, Peter comes and sits down with me to keep me company. It is a very nice feeling to have a pet cat.
                        </p>
